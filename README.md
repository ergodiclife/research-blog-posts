# research-blog-posts
This project includes the code that Euclidean used to generate the
charts in our data (blog) posts at http://www.euclidean.com/data-posts/.
Except for the very first blog post, all the R scripts that generate
the charts are fully self contained. Meaning that if you download an R
program, install the R libraries it depends on, and generate a PDF
file with the chart. Even though the scripts depend on data, the data
is either downloaded from a website or the module comes with the
required data file. Each sub directory of this project corresponds to
a single blog post.
